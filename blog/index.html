The team has had a strong web-centric business for 18 years and began thinking about a mobile App in 2015. Building unique iOS and Android apps wasn’t practical due to our small team and limited native experience. Instead, we decided to take a risk on the very new React Native framework. Our initial commit was on August 12, 2015 using React Native v0.8.0! We were live in both App Stores on October 15, 2016. Over the last two years, we’ve continued to upgrade and expand the app. We are currently on React Native version 0.53.0.</p>
<p>You can check out the app at <a href="https://www.build.com/app">https://www.build.com/app</a>.</p>

<p>Build.com allows each dev to choose the tools that best suit them.</p>
<ul>
<li>IDEs include Atom, IntelliJ, VS Code, Sublime, Eclipse, etc.</li>
<li>For Unit testing, developers are responsible for creating Jest unit tests for any new components and we’re working to increase the coverage of older parts of the app using <code>jest-coverage-ratchet</code>.</li>
<li>We use Jenkins to build out our beta and release candidates. This process works well for us but still requires significant work to create the release notes and other artifacts.</li>
<li>Integration Testing include a shared pool of testers that work across desktop, mobile and web. Our automation engineer is building out our suite of automated integration tests using Java and Appium.</li>
<li>Other parts of the workflow include a detailed eslint configuration, custom rules that enforce properties needed for testing, and pre-push hooks that block offending changes.</li>

<p>The Build.com app relies on a number of common open source libraries including: Redux, Moment, Numeral, Enzyme and a bunch of React Native bridge modules. We also use a number of forked open source libraries; forked either because they were abandoned or because we needed custom features. A quick count shows around 115 JavaScript and native dependencies. We would like to explore tools that remove unused libraries.</p>
<p>We're in the process of adding static typing via TypeScript and looking into optional chaining. These features could help us with solving a couple classes of bugs that we still see:</p>
<ul>
<li>Data that is the wrong type</li>
<li>Data that is undefined because an object didn’t contain what we expected</li>
</ul>

<p>Since we rely so heavily on open source, our team is committed to contributing back to the community. Build.com allows the team to open source libraries that we've built and encourages us contribute back to the libraries that we use.</p>
<p>We’ve released and maintained a number of React Native libraries:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>react-native-polyfill</code></li>
<li><code>react-native-simple-store</code></li>
<li><code>react-native-contact-picker</code></li>
</ul>
<p>We have also contributed to a long list of libraries including: React and React Native, <code>react-native-schemes-manager</code>, <code>react-native-swipeable</code>, <code>react-native-gallery</code>, <code>react-native-view-transformer</code>, <code>react-native-navigation</code>.</p>

<p>We’ve seen a lot of growth in React Native and the ecosystem in the past couple years. Early on, it seemed that every version of React Native would fix some bugs but introduce several more. For example, Remote JS Debugging was broken on Android for several months. Thankfully, things became much more stable in 2017.</p>

<p>One of our big recurring challenges has been with navigation libraries. For a long time, we were using Expo’s ex-nav library. It worked well for us but it was eventually deprecated. However, we were in heavy feature development at the time so taking time to change out a navigation library wasn’t feasible. That meant we had to fork the library and patch it to support React 16 and the iPhone X. Eventually, we were able to migrate to <a href="https://github.com/wix/react-native-navigation"><code>react-native-navigation</code></a> and hopefully that will see continued support.</p>

<p>Another big challenge has been with bridge modules. When we first started, a lot of critical bridges were missing. One of my teammates wrote <code>react-native-contact-picker</code> because we needed access to the Android contact picker in our app. We’ve also seen a lot of bridges that were broken by changes within React Native. For example, there was a breaking change within React Native v40 and when we upgraded our app, I had to submit PRs to fix 3 or 4 libraries that had not yet been updated.</p>

<p>As React Native continues to grow, our wishlist to our community include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Stabilize and improve the navigation libraries</li>
<li>Maintain support for libraries in the React Native ecosystem</li>
<li>Improve the experience for adding native libraries and bridge modules to a project</li>
</ul>
<p>Companies and individuals in the React Native community have been great about volunteering their time and effort to improve the tools that we all use. If you haven’t gotten involved in open source, I hope you’ll take a look at improving the code or documentation for some of the libraries that you use. There are a lot of articles to help you get started and it may be a lot easier than you think!</p>

<p>Three years ago, a GitHub issue was opened to support input accessory view from React Native.</p>
<p><img src="/react-native/blog/assets/input-accessory-1.png"/></p>
<p>In the ensuing years, there have been countless '+1s', various workarounds, and zero concrete changes to RN on this issue - until today. Starting with iOS, <a href="http://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/next/inputaccessoryview.html">we're exposing an API</a> for accessing the native input accessory view and we are excited to share how we built it.</p>
<h2><a class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" id="background"></a><a href="#background" aria-hidden="true" class="hash-link" ><svg aria-hidden="true" height="16" version="1.1" viewBox="0 0 16 16" width="16"><path fill-rule="evenodd" d="M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z"></path></svg></a>Background</h2>
<p>What exactly is an input accessory view? Reading <a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/uikit/uiresponder/1621119-inputaccessoryview?language=objc">Apple's developer documentation</a>, we learn that it's a custom view which can be anchored to the top of the system keyboard whenever a receiver becomes the first responder. Anything that inherits from <code>UIResponder</code> can redeclare the <code>.inputAccessoryView</code> property as read-write, and manage a custom view here. The responder infrastructure mounts the view, and keeps it in sync with the system keyboard. Gestures which dismiss the keyboard, like a drag or tap, are applied to the input accessory view at the framework level. This allows us to build content with interactive keyboard dismissal, an integral feature in top-tier messaging apps like iMessage and WhatsApp.</p>
<p>There are two common use cases for anchoring a view to the top of the keyboard. The first is creating a keyboard toolbar, like the Facebook composer background picker.</p>
<p><img src="/react-native/blog/assets/input-accessory-2.gif" style="float:left; padding-right: 70px; padding-top: 20px"/></p>
<p>In this scenario, the keyboard is focused on a text input field, and the input accessory view is used to provide additional keyboard functionality. This functionality is contextual to the type of input field. In a mapping application it could be address suggestions, or in a text editor, it could be rich text formatting tools.</p>
<hr style="clear: both; margin-bottom: 20px"/>
<p>The Objective-C UIResponder who owns the <code>&lt;InputAccessoryView&gt;</code> in this scenario should be clear. The <code>&lt;TextInput&gt;</code> has become first responder, and under the hood this becomes an instance of <code>UITextView</code> or <code>UITextField</code>.</p>
<p>The second common scenario is sticky text inputs:</p>
<p><img src="/react-native/blog/assets/input-accessory-3.gif" style="float:left; padding-right: 70px; padding-top: 20px"/></p>
<p>Here, the text input is actually part of the input accessory view itself. This is commonly used in messaging applications, where a message can be composed while scrolling through a thread of previous messages.</p>
<hr style="clear: both; margin-bottom: 20px"/>
<p>Who owns the <code>&lt;InputAccessoryView&gt;</code> in this example? Can it be the <code>UITextView</code> or <code>UITextField</code> again? The text input is <em>inside</em> the input accessory view, this sounds like a circular dependency. Solving this issue alone is <a href="http://derpturkey.com/uitextfield-docked-like-ios-messenger/">another blog post</a> in itself. Spoilers: the owner is a generic <code>UIView</code> subclass who we manually tell to <a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/uikit/uiresponder/1621113-becomefirstresponder?language=objc">becomeFirstResponder</a>.</p>
<h2><a class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" id="api-design"></a><a href="#api-design" aria-hidden="true" class="hash-link" ><svg aria-hidden="true" height="16" version="1.1" viewBox="0 0 16 16" width="16"><path fill-rule="evenodd" d="M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z"></path></svg></a>API Design</h2>
<p>We now know what an <code>&lt;InputAccessoryView&gt;</code> is, and how we want to use it. The next step is designing an API that makes sense for both use cases, and works well with existing React Native components like <code>&lt;TextInput&gt;</code>.</p>
<p>For keyboard toolbars, there are a few things we want to consider:</p>
<ol>
<li>We want to be able to hoist any generic React Native view hierarchy into the <code>&lt;InputAccessoryView&gt;</code>.</li>
<li>We want this generic and detached view hierarchy to accept touches and be able to manipulate application state.</li>
<li>We want to link an <code>&lt;InputAccessoryView&gt;</code> to a particular <code>&lt;TextInput&gt;</code>.</li>
<li>We want to be able to share an <code>&lt;InputAccessoryView&gt;</code> across multiple text inputs, without duplicating any code.</li>
</ol>
<p>We can achieve #1 using a concept similar to <a href="https://reactjs.org/docs/portals.html">React portals</a>. In this design, we portal React Native views to a <code>UIView</code> hierarchy managed by the responder infrastructure. Since React Native views render as UIViews, this is actually quite straightforward - we can just override:</p>
<p><code>- (void)insertReactSubview:(UIView *)subview atIndex:(NSInteger)atIndex</code></p>
<p>and pipe all the subviews to a new UIView hierarchy. For #2, we set up a new <a href="https://github.com/facebook/react-native/blob/master/React/Base/RCTTouchHandler.h">RCTTouchHandler</a> for the <code>&lt;InputAccessoryView&gt;</code>. State updates are achieved by using regular event callbacks. For #3 and #4, we use the <a href="https://github.com/facebook/react-native/blob/master/React/Views/UIView%2BReact.h#L28">nativeID</a> field to locate the accessory view UIView hierarchy in native code during the creation of a <code>&lt;TextInput&gt;</code> component. This function uses the <code>.inputAccessoryView</code> property of the underlying native text input. Doing this effectively links <code>&lt;InputAccessoryView&gt;</code> to <code>&lt;TextInput&gt;</code> in their ObjC implementations.</p>
<p>Supporting sticky text inputs (scenario 2) adds a few more constraints. For this design, the input accessory view has a text input as a child, so linking via nativeID is not an option. Instead, we set the <code>.inputAccessoryView</code> of a generic off-screen <code>UIView</code> to our native <code>&lt;InputAccessoryView&gt;</code> hierarchy. By manually telling this generic <code>UIView</code> to become first responder, the hierarchy is mounted by responder infrastructure. This concept is explained thoroughly in the aforementioned blog post.</p>

<p>Of course not everything was smooth sailing while building this API. Here are a few pitfalls we encountered, along with how we fixed them.</p>
<p>An initial idea for building this API involved listening to <code>NSNotificationCenter</code> for UIKeyboardWill(Show/Hide/ChangeFrame) events. This pattern is used in some open-sourced libraries, and internally in some parts of the Facebook app. Unfortunately, <code>UIKeyboardDidChangeFrame</code> events were not being called in time to update the <code>&lt;InputAccessoryView&gt;</code> frame on swipes. Also, changes in keyboard height are not captured by these events. This creates a class of bugs that manifest like this:</p>
<p><img src="/react-native/blog/assets/input-accessory-4.gif" style="float:left; padding-right: 70px; padding-top: 20px"/></p>
<p>On iPhone X, text and emoji keyboard are different heights. Most applications using keyboard events to manipulate text input frames had to fix the above bug. Our solution was to commit to using the <code>.inputAccessoryView</code> property, which meant that the responder infrastructure handles frame updates like this.</p>
<hr style="clear: both; margin-bottom: 20px"/>
<p>Another tricky bug we encountered was avoiding the home pill on iPhone X. You may be thinking, “Apple developed <a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/uikit/uiview/2891102-safearealayoutguide?language=objc">safeAreaLayoutGuide</a> for this very reason, this is trivial!”. We were just as naive. The first issue is that the native <code>&lt;InputAccessoryView&gt;</code> implementation has no window to anchor to until the moment it is about to appear. That's alright, we can override <code>-(BOOL)becomeFirstResponder</code> and enforce layout constraints there. Adhering to these constraints bumps the accessory view up, but another bug arises:</p>
<p><img src="/react-native/blog/assets/input-accessory-5.gif" style="float:left; padding-right: 70px; padding-top: 20px"/></p>
<p>The input accessory view successfully avoids the home pill, but now content behind the unsafe area is visible. The solution lies in this <a href="http://www.openradar.me/34411433">radar</a>. I wrapped the native <code>&lt;InputAccessoryView&gt;</code> hierarchy in a container which doesn't conform to the <code>safeAreaLayoutGuide</code> constraints. The native container covers the content in the unsafe area, while the <code>&lt;InputAccessoryView&gt;</code> stays within the safe area boundaries.</p>

We began with a <a href="https://github.com/awslabs/aws-mobile-react-native-starter">complete starter kit</a>, but have a few more recent developments.</p>

<p>React Native applications are very easy to bootstrap using tools like Create React Native App and Expo. However, connecting them to the cloud can be challenging to navigate when you try to match a use case to infrastructure services. For example, your React Native app might need to upload photos. Should these be protected per user? That probably means you need some sort of registration or sign-in process. Do you want your own user directory or are you using a social media provider? Maybe your app also needs to call an API with custom business logic after users log in.</p>
<p>To help JavaScript developers with these problems, we released a library named AWS Amplify. The design is broken into &quot;categories&quot; of tasks, instead of AWS-specific implementations. For example, if you wanted users to register, log in, and then upload private photos, you would simply pull in <code>Auth</code> and <code>Storage</code> categories to your application:</p>
<pre><code class="hljs"><span class="hljs-keyword">import</span> { Auth } <span class="hljs-keyword">from</span> <span class="hljs-string">'aws-amplify'</span>;

Auth.signIn(username, password)
    .then(<span class="hljs-function"><span class="hljs-params">user</span> =&gt;</span> <span class="hljs-built_in">console</span>.log(user))
    .catch(<span class="hljs-function"><span class="hljs-params">err</span> =&gt;</span> <span class="hljs-built_in">console</span>.log(err));

Auth.confirmSignIn(user, code)
    .then(<span class="hljs-function"><span class="hljs-params">data</span> =&gt;</span> <span class="hljs-built_in">console</span>.log(data))
    .catch(<span class="hljs-function"><span class="hljs-params">err</span> =&gt;</span> <span class="hljs-built_in">console</span>.log(err));
</code></pre>
<p>In the code above, you can see an example of some of the common tasks that Amplify helps you with, such as using multi-factor authentication (MFA) codes with either email or SMS. The supported categories today are:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Auth</strong>: Provides credential automation. Out-of-the-box implementation uses AWS credentials for signing, and OIDC JWT tokens from <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/cognito/">Amazon Cognito</a>. Common functionality, such as MFA features, is supported.</li>
<li><strong>Analytics</strong>: With a single line of code, get tracking for authenticated or unauthenticated users in <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/pinpoint/">Amazon Pinpoint</a>. Extend this for custom metrics or attributes, as you prefer.</li>
<li><strong>API</strong>: Provides interaction with RESTful APIs in a secure manner, leveraging <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/signature-version-4.html">AWS Signature Version 4</a>. The API module is great on serverless infrastructures with <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/api-gateway/">Amazon API Gateway</a>.</li>
<li><strong>Storage</strong>: Simplified commands to upload, download, and list content in <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/s3/">Amazon S3</a>. You can also easily group data into public or private content on a per-user basis.</li>
<li><strong>Caching</strong>: An LRU cache interface across web apps and React Native that uses implementation-specific persistence.</li>
<li><strong>i18n and Logging</strong>: Provides internationalization and localization capabilities, as well as debugging and logging capabilities.</li>
</ul>
<p>One of the nice things about Amplify is that it encodes &quot;best practices&quot; in the design for your specific programming environment. For example, one thing we found working with customers and React Native developers is that shortcuts taken during development to get things working quickly would make it through to production stacks. These can compromise either scalability or security, and force infrastructure rearchitecture and code refactoring.</p>
<p>One example of how we help developers avoid this is the <a href="https://www.allthingsdistributed.com/2016/06/aws-lambda-serverless-reference-architectures.html">Serverless Reference Architectures with AWS Lambda</a>. These show you best practices around using Amazon API Gateway and AWS Lambda together when building your backend. This pattern is encoded into the <code>API</code> category of Amplify. You can use this pattern to interact with several different REST endpoints, and pass headers all the way through to your Lambda function for custom business logic. We’ve also released an <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/aws-mobile/latest/developerguide/react-native-getting-started.html">AWS Mobile CLI</a> for bootstrapping new or existing React Native projects with these features. To get started, just install via <strong>npm</strong>, and follow the configuration prompts:</p>
<pre><code class="hljs"><span class="hljs-built_in">npm</span> install --<span class="hljs-built_in">global</span> awsmobile-cli
awsmobile configure

<p>Another example of encoded best practices that is specific to the mobile ecosystem is password security. The default <code>Auth</code> category implementation leverages Amazon Cognito user pools for user registration and sign-in. This service implements <a href="http://srp.stanford.edu">Secure Remote Password protocol</a> as a way of protecting users during authentication attempts. If you're inclined to read through the <a href="http://srp.stanford.edu/ndss.html#SECTION00032200000000000000">mathematics of the protocol</a>, you'll notice that you must use a large prime number when calculating the password verifier over a primitive root to generate a Group. In React Native environments, <a href="https://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/javascript-environment.html">JIT is disabled</a>. This makes BigInteger calculations for security operations such as this less performant. To account for this, we've released native bridges in Android and iOS that you can link inside your project:</p>
<pre><code class="hljs">npm <span class="hljs-keyword">install</span> <span class="hljs-comment">--save aws-amplify-react-native</span>
react-<span class="hljs-keyword">native</span> <span class="hljs-keyword">link</span> amazon-cognito-<span class="hljs-keyword">identity</span>-js
</code></pre>
<p>We're also excited to see that the Expo team has included this <a href="https://blog.expo.io/expo-sdk-v25-0-0-is-now-available-714d10a8c3f7">in their latest SDK</a> so that you can use Amplify without ejecting.</p>
<p>Finally, specific to React Native (and React) development, Amplify contains <a href="https://reactjs.org/docs/higher-order-components.html">higher order components (HOCs)</a> for easily wrapping functionality, such as for sign-up and sign-in to your app:</p>
<pre><code class="hljs"><span class="hljs-keyword">import</span> <span class="hljs-type">Amplify</span>, { withAuthenticator } from <span class="hljs-symbol">'aws</span>-amplify-react-native';
<span class="hljs-keyword">import</span> aws_exports from './aws-exports';

<span class="hljs-type">Amplify</span>.configure(aws_exports);

<span class="hljs-class"><span class="hljs-keyword">class</span> <span class="hljs-title">App</span> <span class="hljs-keyword">extends</span> <span class="hljs-title">React</span>.<span class="hljs-title">Component</span> </span>{
...
}

export <span class="hljs-keyword">default</span> withAuthenticator(<span class="hljs-type">App</span>);
</code></pre>
<p>The underlying component is also provided as <code>&lt;Authenticator /&gt;</code>, which gives you full control to customize the UI. It also gives you some properties around managing the state of the user, such as if they've signed in or are waiting for MFA confirmation, and callbacks that you can fire when state changes.</p>
<p>Similarly, you'll find general React components that you can use for different use cases. You can customize these to your needs, for example, to show all private images from Amazon S3 in the <code>Storage</code> module:</p>
<pre><code class="hljs"><span class="hljs-tag">&lt;<span class="hljs-name">S3Album</span>
  <span class="hljs-attr">level</span>=<span class="hljs-string">"private"</span>
  <span class="hljs-attr">path</span>=<span class="hljs-string">{path}</span>
  <span class="hljs-attr">filter</span>=<span class="hljs-string">{(item)</span> =&gt;</span> /jpg/i.test(item.path)}/&gt;
</code></pre>
<p>You can control many of the component features via props, as shown earlier, with public or private storage options. There are even capabilities to automatically gather analytics when users interact with certain UI components:</p>
<pre><code class="hljs"><span class="hljs-keyword">return</span> <span class="xml"><span class="hljs-tag">&lt;<span class="hljs-name">S3Album</span> <span class="hljs-attr">track</span>/&gt;</span></span>
</code></pre>
<p>AWS Amplify favors a convention over configuration style of development, with a global initialization routine or initialization at the category level. The quickest way to get started is with an <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/mobile/enhanced-javascript-development-with-aws-mobile-hub/">aws-exports file</a>. However, developers can also use the library independently with existing resources.</p>

<p>Shortly after the launch of AWS Amplify, we also released <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/appsync/">AWS AppSync</a>. This is a fully managed GraphQL service that has both offline and real-time capabilities. Although you can use GraphQL in different client programming languages (including native iOS and Android), it's quite popular among React Native developers. This is because the data model fits nicely into a unidirectional data flow and component hierarchy.</p>
<p>AWS AppSync enables you to connect to resources in your own AWS account, meaning you own and control your data. This is done by using data sources, and the service supports <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/dynamodb/">Amazon DynamoDB</a>, <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/elasticsearch-service/">Amazon Elasticsearch</a>, and <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/lambda/">AWS Lambda</a>. This enables you to combine functionality (such as NoSQL and full-text search) in a single GraphQL API as a schema. This enables you to mix and match data sources. The AppSync service can also <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/appsync/latest/devguide/provision-from-schema.html">provision from a schema</a>, so if you aren't familair with AWS services, you can write GraphQL SDL, click a button, and you're automatically up and running.</p>
<p>The real-time functionality in AWS AppSync is controlled via <a href="http://graphql.org/blog/subscriptions-in-graphql-and-relay/">GraphQL subscriptions with a well-known, event-based pattern</a>. Because subscriptions in AWS AppSync are <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/appsync/latest/devguide/real-time-data.html">controlled on the schema</a> with a GraphQL directive, and a schema can use any data source, this means you can trigger notifications from database operations with Amazon DynamoDB and Amazon Elasticsearch Service, or from other parts of your infrastructure with AWS Lambda.</p>
<p>In a way similar to AWS Amplify, you can use <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/appsync/latest/devguide/security.html">enterprise security features</a> on your GraphQL API with AWS AppSync. The service lets you get started quickly with API keys. However, as you roll to production it can transition to using AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) or OIDC tokens from Amazon Cognito user pools. You can control access at the resolver level with policies on types. You can even use logical checks for <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/appsync/latest/devguide/security.html#fine-grained-access-control">fine-grained access control</a> checks at run time, such as detecting if a user is the owner of a specific database resource. There are also capabilities around checking group membership for executing resolvers or individual database record access.</p>
<p>To help React Native developers learn more about these technologies, there is a <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/appsync/latest/devguide/quickstart.html">built-in GraphQL sample schema</a> that you can launch on the AWS AppSync console homepage. This sample deploys a GraphQL schema, provisions database tables, and connects queries, mutations, and subscriptions automatically for you. There is also a functioning <a href="https://github.com/aws-samples/aws-mobile-appsync-events-starter-react-native">React Native example for AWS AppSync</a> which leverages this built in schema (as well as a <a href="https://github.com/aws-samples/aws-mobile-appsync-events-starter-react">React example</a>), which enable you to get both your client and cloud components running in minutes.</p>
<p>Getting started is simple when you use the <code>AWSAppSyncClient</code>, which plugs in to the <a href="https://github.com/apollographql/apollo-client">Apollo Client</a>. The <code>AWSAppSyncClient</code> handles security and signing for your GraphQL API, offline functionality, and the subscription handshake and negotiation process:</p>
<pre><code class="hljs"><span class="hljs-keyword">import</span> AWSAppSyncClient <span class="hljs-keyword">from</span> <span class="hljs-string">"aws-appsync"</span>;
<span class="hljs-keyword">import</span> { Rehydrated } <span class="hljs-keyword">from</span> <span class="hljs-string">'aws-appsync-react'</span>;
<span class="hljs-keyword">import</span> { AUTH_TYPE } <span class="hljs-keyword">from</span> <span class="hljs-string">"aws-appsync/lib/link/auth-link"</span>;

<span class="hljs-keyword">const</span> client = <span class="hljs-keyword">new</span> AWSAppSyncClient({
  url: awsconfig.graphqlEndpoint,
  region: awsconfig.region,
  auth: {<span class="hljs-keyword">type</span>: AUTH_TYPE.API_KEY, apiKey: awsconfig.apiKey}
});
</code></pre>
<p>The AppSync console provides a configuration file for download, which contains your GraphQL endpoint, AWS Region, and API key. You can then use the client with <a href="https://github.com/apollographql/react-apollo">React Apollo</a>:</p>
<pre><code class="hljs"><span class="hljs-keyword">const</span> WithProvider = <span class="hljs-function"><span class="hljs-params">()</span> =&gt;</span> (
  <span class="xml"><span class="hljs-tag">&lt;<span class="hljs-name">ApolloProvider</span> <span class="hljs-attr">client</span>=<span class="hljs-string">{client}</span>&gt;</span>
      <span class="hljs-tag">&lt;<span class="hljs-name">Rehydrated</span>&gt;</span>
          <span class="hljs-tag">&lt;<span class="hljs-name">App</span> /&gt;</span>
      <span class="hljs-tag">&lt;/<span class="hljs-name">Rehydrated</span>&gt;</span>
  <span class="hljs-tag">&lt;/<span class="hljs-name">ApolloProvider</span>&gt;</span></span>
);
</code></pre>
<p>At this point, you can use standard GraphQL queries:</p>
<pre><code class="hljs">query ListEvents {
    listEvents{
      <span class="hljs-built_in">items</span>{
        <span class="hljs-variable">__typename</span>
        id
        <span class="hljs-built_in">name</span>
        where
        when
        description
        comments{
          <span class="hljs-variable">__typename</span>
          <span class="hljs-built_in">items</span>{
            <span class="hljs-variable">__typename</span>
            eventId
            commentId
            content
            createdAt
          }
          nextToken
        }
      }
    }
}
</code></pre>
<p>The example above shows a query with the sample app schema provisioned by AppSync. It not only showcases interaction with DynamoDB, but also includes pagination of data (including encrypted tokens) and type relations between <code>Events</code> and <code>Comments</code>. Because the app is configured with the <code>AWSAppSyncClient</code>, data is automatically persisted offline and will synchronize when devices reconnect.</p>

<p>Once the app is ready, the Twitter logo delightfully expands, revealing the app.</p>
<p>I wanted to figure out how to recreate this loading animation with React Native.</p>
<hr style="clear: both; margin-bottom: 40px; width: 80px"/>
<p>To understand <em>how</em> to build it, I first had to understand the difference pieces of the loading animation. The easiest way to see the subtlety is to slow it down.</p>
<p><img src="/react-native/blog/assets/loading-screen-02.gif" style="margin-top: 20px; float: left; padding-right: 80px; padding-bottom: 20px"/></p>
<p>There are a few major pieces in this that we will need to figure out how to build.</p>
<ol>
<li>Scaling the bird.</li>
<li>As the bird grows, showing the app underneath</li>
<li>Scaling the app down slightly at the end</li>
</ol>
<p>It took me quite a while to figure out how to make this animation.</p>
<p>I started with an <em>incorrect</em> assumption that the blue background and Twitter bird were a layer on <em>top</em> of the app and that as the bird grew, it became transparent which revealed the app underneath. This approach doesn’t work because the Twitter bird becoming transparent would show the blue layer, not the app underneath!</p>
<p>Luckily for you, dear reader, you don’t have to go through the same frustration I did. You get this nice tutorial skipping to the good stuff!</p>

<p>Before we get to code, it is important to understand how to break this down. To help visualize this effect, I recreated it in <a href="https://codepen.io/TheSavior/pen/NXNoJM">CodePen</a> (embedded in a few paragraphs) so you can interactively see the different layers.</p>
<p><img src="/react-native/blog/assets/loading-screen-03.png" style="float: left; padding-right: 80px; padding-bottom: 20px"/></p>
<p>There are three main layers to this effect. The first is the blue background layer. Even though this seems to appear on top of the app, it is actually in the back.</p>
<p>We then have a plain white layer. And then lastly, in the very front, is our app.</p>
<hr style="clear: both; margin-bottom: 40px; width: 80px"/>
<p><img src="/react-native/blog/assets/loading-screen-04.png" style="float: left; padding-right: 80px; padding-bottom: 20px"/></p>
<p>The main trick to this animation is using the Twitter logo as a <code>mask</code> and masking both the app, and the white layer. I won’t go too deep on the details of masking, there are <a href="https://www.html5rocks.com/en/tutorials/masking/adobe/">plenty</a> of <a href="https://designshack.net/articles/graphics/a-complete-beginners-guide-to-masking-in-photoshop/">resources</a> <a href="https://www.sketchapp.com/docs/shapes/masking/">online</a> for that.</p>
<p>The basics of masking in this context are having images where opaque pixels of the mask show the content they are masking whereas transparent pixels of the mask hide the content they are masking.</p>
<p>We use the Twitter logo as a mask, and having it mask two layers; the solid white layer, and the app layer.</p>
<p>To reveal the app, we scale the mask up until it is larger than the entire screen.</p>
<p>While the mask is scaling up, we fade in the opacity of the app layer, showing the app and hiding the solid white layer behind it. To finish the effect, we start the app layer at a scale &gt; 1, and scale it down to 1 as the animation is ending. We then hide the non-app layers as they will never be seen again.</p>
<p>They say a picture is worth 1,000 words. How many words is an interactive visualization worth? Click through the animation with the “Next Step” button. Showing the layers gives you a side view perspective. The grid is there to help visualize the transparent layers.</p>

<p>Alrighty. Now that we know what we are building and how the animation works, we can get down to the code — the reason you are really here.</p>
<p>The main piece of this puzzle is <a href="https://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/maskedviewios.html">MaskedViewIOS</a>, a core React Native component.</p>
<pre><code class="hljs css javascript"><span class="hljs-keyword">import</span> {MaskedViewIOS} <span class="hljs-keyword">from</span> <span class="hljs-string">'react-native'</span>;

<span class="xml"><span class="hljs-tag">&lt;<span class="hljs-name">MaskedViewIOS</span> <span class="hljs-attr">maskElement</span>=<span class="hljs-string">{</span>&lt;<span class="hljs-attr">Text</span>&gt;</span>Basic Mask<span class="hljs-tag">&lt;/<span class="hljs-name">Text</span>&gt;</span>}&gt;
  <span class="hljs-tag">&lt;<span class="hljs-name">View</span> <span class="hljs-attr">style</span>=<span class="hljs-string">{{backgroundColor:</span> '<span class="hljs-attr">blue</span>'}} /&gt;</span>
<span class="hljs-tag">&lt;/<span class="hljs-name">MaskedViewIOS</span>&gt;</span>;
</span></code></pre>
<p><code>MaskedViewIOS</code> takes props <code>maskElement</code> and <code>children</code>. The children are masked by the <code>maskElement</code>. Note that the mask doesn’t need to be an image, it can be any arbitrary view. The behavior of the above example would be to render the blue view, but for it to be visible only where the words “Basic Mask” are from the <code>maskElement</code>. We just made complicated blue text.</p>
<p>What we want to do is render our blue layer, and then on top render our masked app and white layers with the Twitter logo.</p>
<pre><code class="hljs css javascript">{
  fullScreenBlueLayer;
}
&lt;MaskedViewIOS
  style={{flex: 1}}
  maskElement={
    &lt;View style={styles.centeredFullScreen}&gt;
      &lt;Image source={twitterLogo} /&gt;
    &lt;/View&gt;
  }&gt;
  {fullScreenWhiteLayer}
  &lt;View style={{flex: 1}}&gt;
    &lt;MyApp /&gt;
  &lt;/View&gt;
&lt;/MaskedViewIOS&gt;;
</code></pre>
<p>This will give us the layers we see below.</p>

<p>We have all the pieces we need to make this work, the next step is animating them. To make this animation feel good, we will be utilizing React Native’s <a href="https://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/animated.html">Animated</a> API.</p>
<p>Animated lets us define our animations declaratively in JavaScript. By default, these animations run in JavaScript and tell the native layer what changes to make on every frame. Even though JavaScript will try to update the animation every frame, it will likely not be able to do that fast enough and will cause dropped frames (jank) to occur. Not what we want!</p>
<p>Animated has special behavior to allow you to get animations without this jank. Animated has a flag called <code>useNativeDriver</code> which sends your animation definition from JavaScript to native at the beginning of your animation, allowing the native side to process the updates to your animation without having to go back and forth to JavaScript every frame. The downside of <code>useNativeDriver</code> is you can only update a specific set of properties, mostly <code>transform</code> and <code>opacity</code>. You can’t animate things like background color with <code>useNativeDriver</code>, at least not yet — we will add more over time, and of course you can always submit a PR for properties you need for your project, benefitting the whole community 😀.</p>
<p>Since we want this animation to be smooth, we will work within these constraints. For a more in depth look at how <code>useNativeDriver</code> works under the hood, check out our <a href="https://facebook.github.io/react-native/blog/2017/02/14/using-native-driver-for-animated.html">blog post announcing it</a>.</p>

<p>There are 4 components to our animation:</p>
<ol>
<li>Enlarge the bird, revealing the app and the solid white layer</li>
<li>Fade in the app</li>
<li>Scale down the app</li>
<li>Hide the white layer and blue layer when it is done</li>
</ol>
<p>With Animated, there are two main ways to define your animation. The first is by using <code>Animated.timing</code> which lets you say exactly how long your animation will run for, along with an easing curve to smooth out the motion. The other approach is by using the physics based apis such as <code>Animated.spring</code>. With <code>Animated.spring</code>, you specify parameters like the amount of friction and tension in the spring, and let physics run your animation.</p>
<p>We have multiple animations we want to be running at the same time which are all closely related to each other. For example, we want the app to start fading in while the mask is mid-reveal. Because these animations are closely related, we will use <code>Animated.timing</code> with a single <code>Animated.Value</code>.</p>
<p><code>Animated.Value</code> is a wrapper around a native value that Animated uses to know the state of an animation. You typically want to only have one of these for a complete animation. Most components that use Animated will store the value in state.</p>
<p>Since I’m thinking about this animation as steps occurring at different points in time along the complete animation, we will start our <code>Animated.Value</code> at 0, representing 0% complete, and end our value at 100, representing 100% complete.</p>
<p>Our initial component state will be the following.</p>
<pre><code class="hljs css javascript">state = {
  <span class="hljs-attr">loadingProgress</span>: <span class="hljs-keyword">new</span> Animated.Value(<span class="hljs-number">0</span>),
};
</code></pre>
<p>When we are ready to begin the animation, we tell Animated to animate this value to 100.</p>
<pre><code class="hljs css javascript">Animated.timing(<span class="hljs-keyword">this</span>.state.loadingProgress, {
  <span class="hljs-attr">toValue</span>: <span class="hljs-number">100</span>,
  <span class="hljs-attr">duration</span>: <span class="hljs-number">1000</span>,
  <span class="hljs-attr">useNativeDriver</span>: <span class="hljs-literal">true</span>, <span class="hljs-comment">// This is important!</span>
}).start();
</code></pre>
<p>I then try to figure out a rough estimate of the different pieces of the animations and the values I want them to have at different stages of the overall animation. Below is a table of the different pieces of the animation, and what I think their values should be at different points as we progress through time.</p>
<p><img src="/react-native/blog/assets/loading-screen-05.png" alt=""></p>
<p>The Twitter bird mask should start at scale 1, and it gets smaller before it shoots up in size. So at 10% through the animation, it should have a scale value of .8 before shooting up to scale 70 at the end. Picking 70 was pretty arbitrary to be honest, it needed to be large enough that the bird fully revealed the screen and 60 wasn’t big enough 😀. Something interesting about this part though is that the higher the number, the faster it will look like it is growing because it has to get there in the same amount of time. This number took some trial and error to make look good with this logo. Logos / devices of different sizes will require this end-scale to be different to ensure the entire screen is revealed.</p>
<p>The app should stay opaque for a while, at least through the Twitter logo getting smaller. Based on the official animation, I want to start showing it when the bird is mid way through scaling it up and to fully reveal it pretty quickly. So at 15% we start showing it, and at 30% through the overall animation it is fully visible.</p>
<p>The app scale starts at 1.1 and scales down to its regular scale by the end of the animation.</p>

<p>What we essentially did above is map the values from the animation progress percentage to the values for the individual pieces. We do that with Animated using <code>.interpolate</code>. We create 3 different style objects, one for each piece of the animation, using interpolated values based off of <code>this.state.loadingProgress</code>.</p>
<pre><code class="hljs css javascript"><span class="hljs-keyword">const</span> loadingProgress = <span class="hljs-keyword">this</span>.state.loadingProgress;

<span class="hljs-keyword">const</span> opacityClearToVisible = {
  <span class="hljs-attr">opacity</span>: loadingProgress.interpolate({

    <span class="hljs-attr">outputRange</span>: [<span class="hljs-number">0</span>, <span class="hljs-number">0</span>, <span class="hljs-number">1</span>],
    <span class="hljs-attr">extrapolate</span>: <span class="hljs-string">'clamp'</span>,
    <span class="hljs-comment">// clamp means when the input is 30-100, output should stay at 1</span>
  }),
};

<span class="hljs-keyword">const</span> imageScale = {
  <span class="hljs-attr">transform</span>: [
    {
      <span class="hljs-attr">scale</span>: loadingProgress.interpolate({

        <span class="hljs-attr">outputRange</span>: [<span class="hljs-number">1</span>, <span class="hljs-number">0.8</span>, <span class="hljs-number">70</span>],

      }),
    },
  ],
};

<p>Now that we have these style objects, we can use them when rendering the snippet of the view from earlier in the post. Note that only <code>Animated.View</code>, <code>Animated.Text</code>, and <code>Animated.Image</code> are able to use style objects that use <code>Animated.Value</code>.</p>
<pre><code class="hljs css javascript"><span class="hljs-keyword">const</span> fullScreenBlueLayer = &lt;View style={styles.fullScreenBlueLayer} /&gt;;
const fullScreenWhiteLayer = &lt;View style={styles.fullScreenWhiteLayer} /&gt;;

return (
  &lt;View style={styles.fullScreen}&gt;
    {fullScreenBlueLayer}
    &lt;MaskedViewIOS
      style={{flex: 1}}
      maskElement={
        &lt;View style={styles.centeredFullScreen}&gt;
          &lt;Animated.Image
            style={[styles.maskImageStyle, imageScale]}
            source={twitterLogo}
          /&gt;
        &lt;/View&gt;
      }&gt;
      {fullScreenWhiteLayer}
      &lt;Animated.View style={[opacityClearToVisible, appScale, {flex: 1}]}&gt;
        {this.props.children}
      &lt;/Animated.View&gt;
    &lt;/MaskedViewIOS&gt;

);

<p><img src="/react-native/blog/assets/loading-screen-06.gif" style="float: left; padding-right: 80px; padding-bottom: 20px"/></p>
<p>Yay! We now have the animation pieces looking like we want. Now we just have to clean up our blue and white layers which will never be seen again.</p>
<p>To know when we can clean them up, we need to know when the animation is complete. Luckily where we call, <code>Animated.timing</code> ,<code>.start</code> takes an optional callback that runs when the animation is complete.</p>
<pre><code class="hljs css javascript">Animated.timing(<span class="hljs-keyword">this</span>.state.loadingProgress, {
  <span class="hljs-attr">toValue</span>: <span class="hljs-number">100</span>,
  <span class="hljs-attr">duration</span>: <span class="hljs-number">1000</span>,
  <span class="hljs-attr">useNativeDriver</span>: <span class="hljs-literal">true</span>,
}).start(<span class="hljs-function"><span class="hljs-params">()</span> =&gt;</span> {
  <span class="hljs-keyword">this</span>.setState({
    <span class="hljs-attr">animationDone</span>: <span class="hljs-literal">true</span>,
  });
});
</code></pre>
<p>Now that we have a value in <code>state</code> to know whether we are done with the animation, we can modify our blue and white layers to use that.</p>
<pre><code class="hljs css javascript"><span class="hljs-keyword">const</span> fullScreenBlueLayer = <span class="hljs-keyword">this</span>.state.animationDone ? <span class="hljs-literal">null</span> : (
  &lt;View style={[styles.fullScreenBlueLayer]} /&gt;
);
const fullScreenWhiteLayer = this.state.animationDone ? null : (
  &lt;View style={[styles.fullScreenWhiteLayer]} /&gt;
);
</code></pre>
<p>Voila! Our animation now works and we clean up our unused layers once the animation is done. We have built the Twitter app loading animation!</p>

<ol>
<li><a href="http://browniefed.com/react-native-animation-book/">This gitbook</a> is a great resource to learn more about Animated after you have read the React Native docs.</li>
<li>The actual Twitter animation seems to speed up the mask reveal towards the end. Try modifying the loader to use a different easing function (or a spring!) to better match that behavior.</li>
<li>The current end-scale of the mask is hard coded and likely won’t reveal the entire app on a tablet. Calculating the end scale based on screen size and image size would be an awesome PR.</li>

<li>Congratulations to <a href="https://github.com/dabbott">Devin Abbott</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/hdjirdeh">Houssein Djirdeh</a> on their pre-release of the &quot;Full Stack React Native&quot; book! It walks you through learning React Native by building several small apps. You can try those apps out on <a href="https://www.fullstackreact.com/react-native/">https://www.fullstackreact.com/react-native/</a> before buying the book.</li>
<li>Released a first (experimental) version of <a href="https://github.com/react-community/reason-react-native-scripts">reason-react-native-scripts</a> to help people to easily try out <a href="https://reasonml.github.io/">ReasonML</a>.</li>
<li>Expo SDK 24 is <a href="https://blog.expo.io/expo-sdk-v24-0-0-is-now-available-bfcac3b50d51">released</a>! It uses <a href="https://github.com/facebook/react-native/releases/tag/v0.51.0">React Native 0.51</a> and includes a bunch of new features and improvements: bundling images in standalone apps (no need to cache on first load!), image manipulation API (crop, resize, rotate, flip), face detection API, new release channel features (set the active release for a given channel and rollback), web dashboard to track standalone app builds, and a fix longstanding bug with OpenGL Android implementation and the Android multi-tasker, just to name a few things.</li>
<li>We are allocating more resources to React Navigation starting this January. We strongly believe that it is both possible and desirable to build React Native navigation with just React components and primitives like Animated and <code>react-native-gesture-handler</code> and we’re really excited about some of the improvements we have planned. If you're looking to contribute to the community, check out <a href="https://github.com/react-community/react-native-maps">react-native-maps</a> and <a href="https://github.com/react-native-community/react-native-svg">react-native-svg</a>, which could both use some help!</li>

<li><a href="https://github.com/wix/DetoxInstruments">DetoxInstruments</a>
<ul>
<li>Working on the killer feature of DetoxInstruments proves to be a very challenging task, taking JavaScript backtrace at any given time requires a custom JSCore implementation to support JS thread suspension. Testing the profiler internally on Wix’s app revealed interesting insights about the JS thread.</li>
<li>The project is still not stable enough for general use but is actively worked on, and we hope to announce it soon.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/wix/react-native-navigation">React Native Navigation</a>
<ul>
<li>V2 development pace has been increased substantially, up until now, we only had 1 developer working on it 20% of his time, we now have 3 developers working on it full time!</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Android Performance
<ul>
<li>Replacing the old JSCore bundled in RN with its newest version (tip of webkitGTK project, with custom JIT configuration) produced 40% performance increase on the JS thread. Next up is compiling a 64bit version of it. This effort is based on <a href="https://github.com/SoftwareMansion/jsc-android-buildscripts">JSC build scripts for Android</a>. Follow its current status <a href="https://github.com/DanielZlotin/jsc-android-buildscripts/tree/tip">here</a>.</li>

<p>There's been some discussion on re-purposing this meeting to discuss a single and specific topic (e.g. navigation, moving React Native modules into separate repos, documentation, ...). That way we feel we can contribute the best to React Native community. It might take place in the next meeting session. Feel free to tweet what you'd like to see covered as a topic.</p>

<ul>
<li>We’ve been working on React Native CI. Most importantly, we have migrated from Travis to Circle, leaving React Native with a single, unified CI pipeline.</li>
<li>We’ve organised <a href="https://blog.callstack.io/announcing-hacktoberfest-7313ea5ccf4f">Hacktoberfest - React Native edition</a> where, together with attendees, we tried to submit many pull requests to open source projects.</li>
<li>We keep working on <a href="https://github.com/callstack/haul">Haul</a>. Last month, we have submitted two new releases, including Webpack 3 support. We plan to add <a href="https://github.com/react-community/create-react-native-app">CRNA</a> and <a href="https://github.com/expo/expo">Expo</a> support as well as work on better HMR. Our roadmap is public on the issue tracker. If you would like to suggest improvements or give feedback, let us know!</li>

<li>Released <a href="https://blog.expo.io/expo-sdk-v22-0-0-is-now-available-7745bfe97fc6">Expo SDK 22</a> (using React Native 0.49) and updated <a href="https://github.com/react-community/create-react-native-app">CRNA</a> for it.
<ul>
<li>Includes improved splash screen API, basic ARKit support, “DeviceMotion” API, SFAuthenticationSession support on iOS11, and <a href="https://blog.expo.io/expo-sdk-v22-0-0-is-now-available-7745bfe97fc6">more</a>.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Your <a href="https://snack.expo.io">snacks</a> can now have multiple JavaScript files and you can upload images and other assets by just dragging them into the editor.</li>
<li>Contribute to <a href="https://github.com/react-community/react-navigation">react-navigation</a> to add support for iPhone X.</li>
<li>Focus our attention on rough edges when building large applications with Expo. For example:
<ul>
<li>First-class support for deploying to multiple environments: staging, production, and arbitrary channels. Channels will support rolling back and setting the active release for a given channel. Let us know if you want to be an early tester, <a href="https://twitter.com/expo_io">@expo_io</a>.</li>
<li>We are also working on improving our standalone app building infrastructure and adding support for bundling images and other non-code assets in standalone app builds while keeping the ability to update assets over the air.</li>

<ul>
<li>Better RTL support:
<ul>
<li>We’re introducing a number of direction-aware styles.
<ul>
<li>Position:
<ul>
<li>(left|right) → (start|end)</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Margin:
<ul>
<li>margin(Left|Right) → margin(Start|End)</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Padding:
<ul>
<li>padding(Left|Right) → padding(Start|End)</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Border:
<ul>
<li>borderTop(Left|Right)Radius → borderTop(Start|End)Radius</li>
<li>borderBottom(Left|Right)Radius → borderBottom(Start|End)Radius</li>
<li>border(Left|Right)Width → border(Start|End)Width</li>
<li>border(Left|Right)Color → border(Start|End)Color</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li>The meaning of “left” and “right” were swapped in RTL for position, margin, padding, and border styles. Within a few months, we’re going to remove this behaviour and make “left” always mean “left,” and “right” always mean “right”. The breaking changes are hidden under a flag. Use <code>I18nManager.swapLeftAndRightInRTL(false)</code> in your React Native components to opt into them.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Working on <a href="https://github.com/facebook/flow">Flow</a> typing our internal native modules and using those to generate interfaces in Java and protocols in ObjC that the native implementations must implement. We hope this codegen becomes open source next year, at the earliest.</li>

<ul>
<li>Improving the development flow on Shoutem. We want to streamline the process from creating an app to first custom screen and make it really easy, thus lowering the barrier for new React Native developers. Prepared a few workshops to test out new features. We also improved <a href="https://github.com/shoutem/cli">Shoutem CLI</a> to support new flows.</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/shoutem/ui">Shoutem UI</a> received a few component improvements and bugfixes. We also checked compatibility with latest React Native versions.</li>
<li>Shoutem platform received a few notable updates, new integrations are available as part of the <a href="https://github.com/shoutem/extensions">open-source extensions project</a>. We are really excited to see active development on Shoutem extensions from other developers. We actively contact and offer advice and guidance about their extensions.</li>

<ul>
<li>Announced <a href="https://builderx.io/">BuilderX.io</a> at <a href="https://react-native.eu">React Native EU</a>. BuilderX is a design tool that directly works with JavaScript files (only React Native is supported at the moment) to generate beautiful, readable, and editable code.</li>
<li>Launched <a href="http://reactnativeseed.com/">ReactNativeSeed.com</a> which provides a set of boilerplates for your next React Native project.

<ul>
<li>Will release SDK 21 shortly, which adds support for react-native 0.48.3 and a bunch of bugfixes/reliability improvements/new features in the Expo SDK, including video recording, a new splash screen API, support for <code>react-native-gesture-handler</code>, and improved error handling.</li>
<li>Re: <a href="https://github.com/kmagiera/react-native-gesture-handler">react-native-gesture-handler</a>, <a href="https://github.com/kmagiera">Krzysztof Magiera</a> of <a href="http://swmansion.com/">Software Mansion</a> continues pushing this forward and we've been helping him with testing it and funding part of his development time. Having this integrated in Expo in SDK21 will allow people to play with it easily in Snack, so we're excited to see what people come up with.</li>
<li>Re: improved error logging / handling - see <a href="https://gist.github.com/brentvatne/00407710a854627aa021fdf90490b958">this gist of an internal Expo PR</a> for details on logging, (in particular, &quot;Problem 2&quot;), and <a href="https://github.com/expo/xdl/commit/1d62eca293dfb867fc0afc920c3dad94b7209987">this commit</a> for a change that handles failed attempts to import npm standard library modules. There is plenty of opportunity to improve error messages upstream in React Native in this way and we will work on follow up upstream PRs. It would be great for the community to get involved too.</li>

<ul>
<li>Last month we discussed management of the GitHub issue tracker and that we would try to make improvements to address the maintainability of the project.</li>
<li>Currently, the number of open issues is holding steady at around 600, and it seems like it may stay that way for a while. In the past month, we have closed 690 issues due to lack of activity (defined as no comments in the last 60 days). Out of those 690 issues, 58 were re-opened for a variety of reasons (a maintainer committed to providing a fix, or a contributor made a great case for keeping the issue open).</li>
<li>We plan to continue with the automated closing of stale issues for the foreseeable future. We’d like to be in a state where every impactful issue opened in the tracker is acted upon, but we’re not there yet. We need all the help we can from maintainers to triage issues and make sure we don't miss issues that introduce regressions or introduce breaking changes, especially those that affect newly created projects. People interested in helping out can use the Facebook GitHub Bot to triage issues and pull requests. The new <a href="https://facebook.github.io/react-native/maintainers.md">Maintainers Guide</a> contains more information on triage and use of the GitHub Bot. Please add yourself to the <a href="https://github.com/facebook/react-native/blob/master/bots/IssueCommands.txt">issue task force</a> and encourage other active community members to do the same!</li>

<ul>
<li>The new Skype app is built on top of React Native in order to facilitate sharing as much code between platforms as possible. The React Native-based Skype app is currently available in the iOS and Android app stores.</li>
<li>While building the Skype app on React Native, we send pull requests to React Native in order to address bugs and missing features that we come across. So far, we've gotten about <a href="https://github.com/facebook/react-native/pulls?utf8=%E2%9C%93&amp;q=is%3Apr%20author%3Arigdern%20">70 pull requests merged</a>.</li>
<li>React Native enabled us to power both the iOS and Android Skype apps from the same codebase. We also want to use that codebase to power the Skype web app. To help us achieve that goal, we built and open sourced a thin layer on top of React/React Native called <a href="https://microsoft.github.io/reactxp/blog/2017/04/06/introducing-reactxp.html">ReactXP</a>. ReactXP provides a set of cross platform components that get mapped to React Native when targeting iOS/Android and to react-dom when targeting the web. ReactXP's goals are similar to another open source library called React Native for Web. There's a brief description of how the approaches of these libraries differ in the <a href="https://microsoft.github.io/reactxp/faq.md">ReactXP FAQ</a>.</li>

It is available in a dozen or so countries and enables users to discover products and services provided by other users.</p>
<p>In the first half of 2017, through the joint effort of the Relay Team, the Marketplace team, the Mobile JS Platform team, and the React Native team, we cut Marketplace Time to Interaction (TTI) in half for Android <a href="https://code.facebook.com/posts/307478339448736/year-class-a-classification-system-for-android/">Year Class 2010-11 devices</a>.

<p>A typical React Native startup looks something like this:</p>

<p>Disclaimer: ratios aren't representative and will vary depending on how React Native is configured and used.</p>

<p>We first initialize the React Native core (aka the “Bridge”) before running the product specific JavaScript which determines what native views React Native will render in the Native Processing Time.</p>

<p>One of the earlier mistakes that we made was to let <a href="https://code.facebook.com/posts/747457662026706/performance-instrumentation-for-android-apps/">Systrace and CTScan</a> drive our performance efforts. These tools helped us find a lot of low-hanging fruit in 2016, but we discovered that both Systrace and CTScan are <strong>not representative of production scenarios</strong> and cannot emulate what happens in the wild. Ratios of time spent in the breakdowns are often incorrect and, wildly off-base at times. At the extreme, some things that we expected to take a few milliseconds actually take hundreds or thousands of milliseconds. That said, CTScan is useful and we've found it catches a third of regressions before they hit production.</p>
<p>On Android, we attribute the shortcomings of these tools to the fact that 1) React Native is a multithreaded framework, 2) Marketplace is co-located with a multitude of complex views such as Newsfeed and other top-level tabs, and 3) computation times vary wildly. Thus, this half, we let production measurements and breakdowns drive almost all of our decision making and prioritization.</p>

<p>Instrumenting production may sound simple on the surface, but it turned out to be quite a complex process. It took multiple iteration cycles of 2-3 weeks each; due to the latency of landing a commit in master, to pushing the app to the Play Store, to gathering sufficient production samples to have confidence in our work. Each iteration cycle involved discovering if our breakdowns were accurate, if they had the right level of granularity, and if they properly added up to the whole time span. We could not rely on alpha and beta releases because they are not representative of the general population. In essence, we very tediously built a very accurate production trace based on the aggregate of millions of samples.</p>
<p>One of the reasons we meticulously verified that every millisecond in breakdowns properly added up to their parent metrics was that we realized early on there were gaps in our instrumentation. It turned out that our initial breakdowns did not account for stalls caused by thread jumps. Thread jumps themselves aren't expensive, but thread jumps to busy threads already doing work are very expensive. We eventually reproduced these blockages locally by sprinkling <code>Thread.sleep()</code> calls at the right moments, and we managed to fix them by:</p>
<ol>
<li>removing our dependency on AsyncTask,</li>
<li>undoing the forced initialization of ReactContext and NativeModules on the UI thread, and</li>
<li>removing the dependency on measuring the ReactRootView at initialization time.</li>
</ol>
<p>Together, removing these thread blockage issues reduced the startup time by over 25%.</p>
<p>Production metrics also challenged some of our prior assumptions. For example, we used to pre-load many JavaScript modules on the startup path under the assumption that co-locating modules in one bundle would reduce their initialization cost. However, the cost of pre-loading and co-locating these modules far outweighed the benefits. By re-configuring our inline require blacklists and removing JavaScript modules from the startup path, we were able to avoid loading unnecessary modules such as Relay Classic (when only <a href="https://facebook.github.io/relay/new-in-relay-modern.md">Relay Modern</a> was necessary). Today, our <code>RUN_JS_BUNDLE</code> breakdown is over 75% faster.</p>
<p>We also found wins by investigating product-specific native modules. For example, by lazily injecting a native module's dependencies, we reduced that native module's cost by 98%. By removing the contention of Marketplace startup with other products, we reduced startup by an equivalent interval.</p>
<p>The best part is that many of these improvements are broadly applicable to all screens built with React Native.</p>

<p>People assume that React Native startup performance problems are caused by JavaScript being slow or exceedingly high network times. While speeding up things like JavaScript would bring down TTI by a non-trivial sum, each of these contribute a much smaller percentage of TTI than was previously believed.</p>
<p>The lesson so far has been to <em>measure, measure, measure!</em> Some wins come from moving run-time costs to build time, such as Relay Modern and <a href="https://github.com/facebook/react-native/commit/797ca6c219b2a44f88f10c61d91e8cc21e2f306e">Lazy NativeModules</a>. Other wins come from avoiding work by being smarter about parallelizing code or removing dead code. And some wins come from large architectural changes to React Native, such as cleaning up thread blockages. There is no grand solution to performance, and longer-term performance wins will come from incremental instrumentation and improvements. Do not let cognitive bias influence your decisions. Instead, carefully gather and interpret production data to guide future work.</p>

<p>In the long term, we want Marketplace TTI to be comparable to similar products built with Native, and, in general, have React Native performance on par with native performance. Further more, although this half we drastically reduced the bridge startup cost by about 80%, we plan to bring the cost of the React Native bridge close to zero via projects like <a href="https://prepack.io/">Prepack</a> and more build time processing.</p>

<li>Recently launched <a href="https://native.directory">Native Directory</a> to help with discoverability and evaluation of libraries in React Native ecosystem. The problem: lots of libraries, hard to test, need to manually apply heuristics and not immediately obvious which ones are just the best ones that you should use. It's also hard to know if something is compatible with CRNA/Expo. So Native Directory tries to solve these problems. Check it out and <a href="https://github.com/react-community/native-directory">add your library</a> to it. The list of libraries is in <a href="https://github.com/react-community/native-directory/blob/master/react-native-libraries.json">here</a>. This is just our first pass of it, and we want this to be owned and run by the community, not just Expo folks. So please pitch in if you think this is valuable and want to make it better!</li>
<li>Added initial support for installing npm packages in <a href="https://snack.expo.io/">Snack</a> with Expo SDK 19. Let us know if you run into any issues with it, we are still working through some bugs. Along with Native Directory, this should make it easy to test libraries that have only JS dependencies, or dependencies included in <a href="https://github.com/expo/expo-sdk">Expo SDK</a>. Try it out:

<li>Contributions to React Native are very welcome! If you are wondering how you can contribute, the <a href="http://facebook.github.io/react-native/contributing.md">&quot;How to Contribute&quot; guide</a> describes our development process and lays out the steps to send your first pull request. There are other ways to contribute that do not require writing code, such as by triaging issues or updating the docs.

<li>At the time of writing, React Native has <strong>635</strong> <a href="https://github.com/facebook/react-native/issues">open issues</a> and <strong>249</strong> <a href="https://github.com/facebook/react-native/pulls">open pull requests</a>. This is overwhelming for our maintainers, and when things get fixed internally, it is difficult to ensure the relevant tasks are updated.</li>
<li>We are unsure what the best approach is to handle this while keeping the community satisfied. Some (but not all!) options include closing stale issues, giving significantly more people permissions to manage issues, and automatically closing issues that do not follow the issue template. We wrote a <a href="http://facebook.github.io/react-native/maintainers.md">&quot;What to Expect from Maintainers&quot;</a> guide to set expectations and avoid surprises. If you have ideas on how we can make this experience better for maintainers as well as ensuring people opening issues and pull requests feel heard and valued, please let us know!</li>

<ul>
<li>We demoed the Designer Tool which works with React Native files on Chain React. Many attendees signed up for the waiting list.</li>
<li>We are also looking at other cross-platform solutions like <a href="https://flutter.io/">Google Flutter</a> (a major comparison coming along), <a href="https://github.com/JetBrains/kotlin-native">Kotlin Native</a>, and <a href="https://weex.incubator.apache.org/">Apache Weex</a> to understand the architectural differences and what we can learn from them to improve the overall performance of React Native.</li>
<li>Switched to <a href="https://github.com/react-community/react-navigation">react-navigation</a> for most of our apps, which has improved the overall performance.</li>
<li>Also, announced <a href="https://market.nativebase.io/">NativeBase Market</a> - A marketplace for React Native components and apps (for and by the developers).</li>

<ul>
<li><a href="https://github.com/Microsoft/code-push">CodePush</a> has now been integrated into <a href="https://mobile.azure.com/">Mobile Center</a>. Existing users will have no change in their workflow.
<ul>
<li>Some people have reported an issue with duplicate apps - they already had an app on Mobile Center. We are working on resolving them, but if you have two apps, let us know, and we can merge them for you.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Mobile Center now supports Push Notifications for CodePush. We also showed how a combination of Notifications and CodePush could be used for A/B testing apps - something unique to the ReactNative architecture.</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode">VSCode</a> has a known debugging issue with ReactNative - the next release of the extension in a couple of days will be fixing the issue.</li>
<li>Since there are many other teams also working on React Native inside Microsoft, we will work on getting better representation from all the groups for the next meeting.</li>

<ul>
<li>Finished the process of making the React Native development easier on <a href="https://shoutem.github.io/">Shoutem</a>. You can use all the standard <code>react-native</code> commands when developing apps on Shoutem.</li>
<li>We did a lot of work trying to figure out how to best approach the profiling on React Native. A big chunk of <a href="https://facebook.github.io/react-native/performance.md">documentation</a> is outdated, and we'll do our best to create a pull request on the official docs or at least write some of our conclusions in a blog post.</li>
<li>Switching our navigation solution to <a href="https://github.com/react-community/react-navigation">react-navigation</a>, so we might have some feedback soon.</li>
<li>We released <a href="https://github.com/shoutem/ui/tree/develop/html">a new HTML component</a> in our toolkit which transforms the raw HTML to the React Native components tree.</li>

<ul>
<li>We started working on a pull request to <a href="https://github.com/facebook/metro">Metro Bundler</a> with <a href="https://github.com/wix/react-native-repackager">react-native-repackager</a> capabilities. We updated react-native-repackager to support RN 44 (which we use in production). We are using it for our mocking infrastructure for <a href="https://github.com/wix/detox">detox</a>.</li>
<li>We have been covering the Wix app in detox tests for the last three weeks. It's an amazing learning experience of how to reduce manual QA in an app of this scale (over 40 engineers). We have resolved several issues with detox as a result, a new version was just published. I am happy to report that we are living up to the &quot;zero flakiness policy&quot; and the tests are passing consistently so far.</li>
<li>Detox for Android is moving forward nicely. We are getting significant help from the community. We are expecting an initial version in about two weeks.</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/wix/detoxinstruments">DetoxInstruments</a>, our performance testing tool, is getting a little bigger than we originally intended. We are now planning to turn it into a standalone tool that will not be tightly coupled to detox. It will allow investigating the performance of iOS apps in general. It will also be integrated with detox so we can run automated tests on performance metrics.</li>

<p>The next session is scheduled for August 16, 2017. As this was only our second meeting, we'd like to know how do these notes benefit the React Native community. Feel free to ping me <a href="https://twitter.com/TomislavTenodi">on Twitter</a> if you have any suggestion on how we should improve the output of the meeting.</p>
